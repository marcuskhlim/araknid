# Introduction #

Araknid is written in Adobe's ActionScript 3 language, which is used to create content for web (Flash), desktop (AIR), and mobile (AIR mobile).
Users wishing to compile their own binaries are encouraged to download
and install compilers capable of directly compiling the source code.


# Development Environment #

The ideal development environment will include:
  * Flash CS6
  * Adobe Flex / Flash Builder (3 or later)
  * FlashDevelop (optional alternative to Flex / Flash Builder)
  * Apache Flex (optional alternative to Flex / Flash Builder and FlashDevelop)

Although Flash CS6 is highly recommended, another user interface may be constructed and linked within Flex / Flash Builder. All UI components used are standard Flash or Flex components.
