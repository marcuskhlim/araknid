Introduction

Written in ActionScript for Adobe AIR, Araknid is a small, portable web crawler and archiver. It can be used to crawl an entire site, domain, or the whole web.

Araknid stores its data in an external SQLite database, making it easily accessible using third-party tools such as SQLite Database Browser (http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/).

Common uses for Araknid may include:

1. Storing and archiving an entire site for later viewing.
2. Creating an independent search index for your own site.
3. Backing up site contents.
